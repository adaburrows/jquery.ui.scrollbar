jQuery UI Scrollbar
===================

Usage
-----

Using the plugin is simple. After you include jQuery, jQuery UI,
```js/jquery.ui.scrollbar.js``` (or the minified version), and
```css/jquery.ui.scrollbar.css``` just call:

```js
$(document).ready(function()
{
  $(".scroll-pane").scrollbar({orientation: 'vertical'});
});
```

Where ```.scroll-pane``` is the name of the element(s) you want to wrap. By
default the plugin will set the orientation to 'horizontal'.

Options
-------

Other options that can be set are:

* ```scrollFactor``` - How far the mousewheel will scroll per event.
* ```easing``` - The easing function to use for the scrolling animation.
* ```animationDuration``` - How long (in milliseconds) the animation will take for one unit (divided by distance).

Changes you may need to make
----------------------------

The CSS has been modified to use greys, removing the color specifics will let
it use your default jQuery UI theme.
